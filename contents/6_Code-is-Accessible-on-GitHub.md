# 6. Code is Accessible on GitHub

Hi,

Before we dive into coding with jQuery, I want you to know that the code for each lecture (sometimes in a slightly modified form) is available on GitHub here: https://github.com/petersommerhoff/jquery-course/tree/master

Each lecture also has a link to the appropriate folder of this repository for reference, so you can quickly access it there as well.

The code on GitHub contains lots of documentation which further explains the concepts, such as how and why the functions are used. So make sure to check them out to get more comfortable with the concepts presented in each lecture.

You can always compare your code with the code in the repository to better find bugs.

That's all, happy coding!

Cheers,
