“Good demonstrations on how to use various jQuery methods. As a beginner, I really liked the mini-challenges spread throughout most of the lectures.”

“It was perfect for my level of expertise. The end result catapulted me ahead with a much better understanding of not only jquery, but with a few well-placed examples, also JavaScript and debugging.”
**-Larry Loreman**

“A very well laid out class, it truly is a beginner to advanced course. It does help to have at least an introductory level of knowledge to Javascript. My favorite part is that all the course code is available on Github, which allows you to download each sections code so you can troubleshoot against mistakes you may have made along the way.”
